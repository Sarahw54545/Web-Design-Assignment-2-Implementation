			<h2 class="section-title">What is Common Entry?</h2>
			<p>The Common Entry Scheme within Exercise Sciences offers a unique pathway for students to embark on their academic journey with a broad yet focused approach. Over the initial two years of study, participants delve into a comprehensive curriculum designed to provide a robust foundation in various aspects of Exercise Science.</p>
			
			<p>Through a combination of theoretical exploration and hands-on practical placements, students gain invaluable insights into the multifaceted realm of exercise science. This immersive experience serves as a springboard for students to explore diverse career avenues within the field, ranging from fitness and movement to nutrition and positive psychology.</p>
				
			<p>By exposing students to a wide array of subjects, the Common Entry Scheme equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed decisions regarding their specialization. As students progress through the program, they have the opportunity to tailor their academic trajectory by selecting one of three specialized exit pathways:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>BSc (Hons) in Sport &amp; Exercise Science</li>
			<li>BSc (Hons) in Nutrition &amp; Exercise Science</li>
			<li>BSc (Hons) in Health &amp; Exercise Science</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>This flexible structure empowers students to customize their educational experience based on their interests, passions, and career aspirations, ensuring they are well-prepared to excel in their chosen field upon graduation.</p>
